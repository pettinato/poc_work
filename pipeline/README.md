Recommendations POC
==============================

Summary
==============================
This Analysis is aimed to get comfortable with Python Sklearn Pipelines 
for building and selecting models.

Dataset
==============================

This project will use the `aps_failure_training_set.csv` dataset available 
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00421/)

This dataset is comma delimited.  It has a ton of rows and columns but for the POC the number
of features has been limited.

Analysis Performed
==============================
Built sklearn pipelines including looking at grid search and 
looping through a few models to choose the best one..

Future Work
==============================
Custom transformations instead of just using the built in sklearn transformations.
